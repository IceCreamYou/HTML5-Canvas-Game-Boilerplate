The examples in this folder are intended to illustrate the rapid prototyping
tools provided by this project. They also serve as integration tests; if these
examples run well then the framework is working as expected.

In this directory you can browse the HTML and JavaScript source and get the
images used. A brief explanation of each example, the concepts they illustrate,
and associated tutorials are listed below.

 - [Platformer (Mario)](https://icecreamyou.github.io/HTML5-Canvas-Game-Boilerplate/examples/mario.html)
   ([tutorial](https://icecreamyou.github.io/HTML5-Canvas-Game-Boilerplate/docs/#!/guide/walkthrough)) -
   The player controls a character that can run and jump around as well as
   shoot fireballs at enemies in a side-scrolling world. A good illustration of
   parallax layers, world geometry and collisions, simple class inheritance,
   and animated sprites
 - [Command & Conquer-style RTS](https://icecreamyou.github.io/HTML5-Canvas-Game-Boilerplate/examples/cnc.html)
   ([tutorial](https://icecreamyou.github.io/HTML5-Canvas-Game-Boilerplate/docs/#!/guide/mouse)) -
   Use the mouse to scroll around a top-down world and select and control
   soldiers in order to conquer the enemy base. A good illustration of mouse
   interaction (scrolling, zooming, tracking, events, etc.), advanced class
   inheritance, and collections
 - [Paint](https://icecreamyou.github.io/HTML5-Canvas-Game-Boilerplate/examples/paint.html) -
   The classic paint program; select different colors or shapes and draw onto
   the canvas. A good illustration of mobile support, HTML menus,
   mouse tracking, and Layers
 - [Snake](https://icecreamyou.github.io/HTML5-Canvas-Game-Boilerplate/examples/snake.html) -
   The classic eat-the-pellet game. Illustrates resizing to fit the window,
   custom movement mechanics and keyboard handling, drawing text, and storing
   high scores
 - [Breakout](https://icecreamyou.github.io/HTML5-Canvas-Game-Boilerplate/examples/breakout.html) -
   The classic ball-and-paddle game. Most of the concepts this uses are covered
   by other examples but they are used in a simpler way here
 - [Pacman](https://icecreamyou.github.io/HTML5-Canvas-Game-Boilerplate/examples/pacman.html) -
   Control a character who moves around a maze eating dots. Illustrates a
   fixed-ratio-size canvas, complex inheritence, complex movement mechanics,
   collision, Layers, and map layout.
 - [Default project](https://icecreamyou.github.io/HTML5-Canvas-Game-Boilerplate/) -
   A full-size canvas with a keyboard-controlled character and top-down
   (four-way) scrolling

Every example except Paint and RTS has keyboard-controlled movement. Paint and
Breakout have full mobile support. The Platformer and RTS examples use most of
the framework's high-level features.
